# Advanced-Disk-Scheduling
The Advanced Disk Scheduler project aims to create an intelligent system that optimizes disk I/O operations in computer systems. The project will develop a scheduler that improves upon traditional disk scheduling algorithms (like FCFS, SSTF, SCAN) by incorporating machine learning to predict access patterns and adapt dynamically to workloads.
